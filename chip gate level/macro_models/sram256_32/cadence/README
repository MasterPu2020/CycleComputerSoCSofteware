Dear customer,


Please read the following notices concerning the memory Verilog
model you have received.


INSTALLATION:
=============

The shipment of Cadence Verilog model is done in with different
options:
   * as a Cadence cell with the following views:
     symbol, functional, msps, abstract (Cellensemble)
     and the compiled TLF file for this cell.
   * LEF file for Silicon ensemble.
   * source code of Verilog model for other simulators, source
     code of TLF and a black box description of the outlines
     in ASCII format.


TIMING MODELS:
==============

The Verilog code of a memory is a FUNCTIONAL MODEL ONLY, which has
no delay data and no setup/hold data included. Timing information
MUST be added by annoatating a SDF file to the model.

Therefore a "tlf" for Cadence Tools is added to this shipment.
In the Delay Calculator (Cadence 4.4.1) or with Pearl (Cadence 4.4.3)
exact timing data in dependeny of input slope/output load and
temp/volt./process derating can be calculted for your design, the
delay data are stored in a SDF file.
This SDF file can be annotated into a Verilog simulation as well
as into a VHDL simulation you have received.

Please refer also to our design flow documentation.


The timing data in the "tlf" file are vaild only for one nominal supply
voltage 3.3V !

3.3V models can be combined with the dig. Std. cell library "HRDLIB".


ROM DATA INSERTION:
===================

ROM memory data are specified in a seperated file, located outside
the simulation model.
    
The ROM data format is:

                       00000000    -- first address
                       00000001
                       00000011
                       00000111
                       ....
                       00001111
                       00011110
                       00111100   -- last address
                       |      |
                       |      |
                      MSB    LSB


In the Verilog model there is a "prog" parameter defined, where this
romdata file is noticed to the Verilog model.
The "prog" parameter string for defining the ROM data file MUST NOT
exceed 28 characters in Cadence Design Frame work.

In the compilation of the functional view of the Cadence cell, this
"prog" parameter is undefined. The name of the data file must be added
in the functional view and the view must be recompiled !
