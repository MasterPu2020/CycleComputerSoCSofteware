Dear customer,


Please read the following notices concerning the memory Synopsys model
you have received.


INSTALLATION:
=============

The Synopsys memory model is a black box model with no functionality
in the Synopsys ".lib" format. But it contains full timing informations.
This model enables to perform timing calculations for a design containing
memories.

The std.cell libraries for 0.35um CMOS "csd" contain nonlinear
table look-up timing models, this Synopsys memory models contain linear
timing models. Therefore it is NOT possible to mix digital std. cell
models and memory models in ONE library.

Please keep memory models in a seperated library (e.g. memlib).

This shipment contains the Synopsys source code and a compiled version
of the library. The compilation was done with Synopsys release 99.10.
If the compilation does not work with your Synopsys release, the source
code can be compiled in Design Analyzer with the commands "read_lib"
and "write_lib". For the compilation the library compiler license
is necessary.

At compilation of memory models there will be "Warnings", since the delay
path EN --> Q is modelled as a tri-state path in a black box model.

A "SDF" file generated from Design compiler can be annotated into
the Verilog or the VHDL simulation model.

NOTE:
-----

For Synopsys Release 99.05 the following switch must be set for
SDF file generation:
                   sdfout_no_edge = true


TIMING MODELS:
==============

The timing data in the Synopsys model file are vaild only for
one nominal supply voltage 3.3V !

3.3V models can be combined with the dig. Std. cell library "csd"
or "csi".
